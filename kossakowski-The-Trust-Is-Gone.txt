0 You were the one I thought I could always depend on
4 We had each other's backs, through thick and thin
7 But now it feels like the trust we had is gone
12 And I can't help but wonder where we went wrong
20 You were my best friend, my confidant
24 But now it feels like I'm all alone
27 You stabbed me in the back, left me out in the cold
30 I never thought you'd be the one to break the mold
35 I thought we were in this together, side by side
42 But now it feels like you're a stranger in disguise
48 You played me for a fool, believed in all your lies
52 Now I'm left picking up the pieces of our shattered ties
58 You were my best friend, my confidant
61 But now it feels like I'm all alone
65 You stabbed me in the back, left me out in the cold
69 I never thought you'd be the one to break the mold
73 I trusted you with everything I had
76 But now it feels like the trust we had is dead
80 I never saw this coming, never realized
83 That you would be the one to leave me behind
86 You were my best friend, my confidant
90 But now it feels like I'm all alone
94 You stabbed me in the back, left me out in the cold
97 I never thought you'd be the one to break the mold
101 Now I'm left here with a broken heart
104 Trying to piece together what we had from the start
109 But the trust is gone, the damage done
112 And I'm left wondering where it all went wrong
