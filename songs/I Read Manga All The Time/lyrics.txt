0 In the pages of my manga book,
3 I wish for a girl with a meaningful look,
6 To step out of the ink and into my world,
11 Where loneliness and sorrow are unfurled.
15 But the pages remain still, silent, and cold,
18 As I navigate this world, feeling old,
22 In the depths of my despair, I drown,
27 Wishing for a love that can't be found.
31 Life's a struggle, a relentless fight,
36 Alone in this world, feeling forlorn.
42 In the colorful panels, feeling forlorn.
57 In the colorful panels, I find escape,
60 But reality's grip is hard to reshape,
63 I long for a touch, a voice to hear,
67 To chase away the shadows of my fear.
70 But the characters remain trapped within,
73 As I search for a love I can't begin,
76 In this void of emptiness, I dwell,
80 In the silence of my lonely shell.
84 Wishing for a love that can't be found
89 Life's a struggle, a relentless fight,
93 Alone in this world, feeling forlorn.
99 In the colorful panels, feeling forlorn.
108 In the colorful panels, feeling forlorn.
113 In the echoes of the night, I cry,
117 As the stars above seem to pass me by,
