1 In a virtual world, he found a friend,
3 A connection so deep, it seemed to transcend.
6 Through screens and keyboards, their bond did extend,
9 Their shared love for stories, a trend they defend.
12 Their discussions flowed like rivers at night,
15 Anime, manga, novels, pure delight.
18 With each passing day, their friendship took flight,
21 But her identity remained out of sight.
24 Lost in the web of the digital tide,
27 He searched for her, his heart open wide.
29 Does she live in a city, or countryside?
32 He wonders if their love could ever coincide.
38 Through pixels and bytes, they shared their dreams,
41 Their laughter echoing through cyberspace streams.
44 But behind the avatar, reality gleams,
47 And the truth of her whereabouts, he desperately deems.
53 Their imaginations soared to celestial height,
55 But reality lingered, veiled in night.
58 He yearned to meet her, to hold her tight,
60 But her location remained cloaked in the digital light.
67 Lost in the web of the digital tide,
70 He searched for her, his heart open wide.
73 Does she live in a city, or countryside?
76 He wonders if their love could ever coincide.
91 Then one day, silence, no more replies,
93 Leaving him questioning, with tear-filled eyes.
102 But her location remained cloaked in the digital light.
107 Lost in the web of the digital tide,
110 He searched for her, his heart open wide.
113 Does she live in a city, or countryside?
114 He wonders if their love could ever coincide.
