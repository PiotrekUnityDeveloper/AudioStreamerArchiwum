0 Underneath the moon's soft glow,
2 In the quiet of the night, I stroll,
7 Through an empty field, I wander alone,
13 Lost in thoughts, in this world I've known.
20 The stars above whisper tales untold,
26 As I walk these paths, feeling bold,
28 In the solitude of the darkened park,
33 I find solace in the silence, in the dark.
39 Walking alone, beneath the midnight sky,
43 Lost in contemplation, asking why,
46 In the stillness, I find my way,
49 Through the echoes of the night, I'll sway.
52 With each step, memories unfold,
55 Of the stories left untold,
59 In the gentle breeze, I feel the grace,
62 As I journey through this empty space.
65 In the rustling leaves, I hear a sigh,
68 As the night whispers secrets, passing by,
72 In the solitude of the empty field,
76 I find the strength within to yield.
81 Walking alone, beneath the midnight sky,
85 Lost in contemplation, asking why,
88 In the stillness, I find my way,
91 Through the echoes of the night, I'll sway.
102 In the quiet of the night, I find peace,
107 As the world around me starts to cease,
111 With each heartbeat, I embrace the calm,
114 In this solitary walk, I find my balm.
