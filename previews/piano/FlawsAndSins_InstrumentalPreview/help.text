[HOW TO USE THIS]
I HAVE NO IDEA, JUST CREATED THIS FOR FUN
[LIMITATIONS]
- 1 - A LOT OF NOTES PLAYED AT THE SAME TIME WILL REQUIRE A BEEFY COMPUTER, OTHERWISE IT WILL LAG AND NOT SYNC WITH THE TRACK.
- 2 - THE SOURCE METHOD IS NOT USING A PARENT CONTROL TO MOVE ALL THE NOTES. THEY ARE SEPARATED. PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION
