[00:01.27]In a virtual world, he found a friend,
[00:03.88]A connection so deep, it seemed to transcend.
[00:06.80]Through screens and keyboards, their bond did extend,
[00:09.66]Their shared love for stories, a trend they defend.

[00:12.50]Their discussions flowed like rivers at night,
[00:15.38]Anime, manga, novels, pure delight.
[00:18.43]With each passing day, their friendship took flight,
[00:21.20]But her identity remained out of sight.

[00:24.74]Lost in the web of the digital tide,
[00:27.04]He searched for her, his heart open wide.
[00:29.80]Does she live in a city, or countryside?
[00:32.88]He wonders if their love could ever coincide.

[00:38.97]Through pixels and bytes, they shared their dreams,
[00:41.67]Their laughter echoing through cyberspace streams.
[00:44.58]But behind the avatar, reality gleams,
[00:47.98]And the truth of her whereabouts, he desperately deems.

[00:53.50]Their imaginations soared to celestial height,
[00:55.96]But reality lingered, veiled in night.
[00:58.87]He yearned to meet her, to hold her tight,
[01:00.75]But her location remained cloaked in the digital light.

[01:07.26]Lost in the web of the digital tide,
[01:10.61]He searched for her, his heart open wide.
[01:13.41]Does she live in a city, or countryside?
[01:16.43]He wonders if their love could ever coincide.

[01:31.02]Then one day, silence, no more replies,
[01:33.42]Leaving him questioning, with tear-filled eyes.

[01:42.75]But her location remained cloaked in the digital light.

[01:47.74]Lost in the web of the digital tide,
[01:50.13]He searched for her, his heart open wide.
[01:53.03]Does she live in a city, or countryside?
[01:54.75]He wonders if their love could ever coincide.

[02:34.21]Through pixels and bytes, they shared their dreams,
[02:36.66]Their laughter echoing through cyberspace streams.
[02:39.79]But behind the avatar, reality gleams,
[02:45.28]And the truth of her whereabouts, he desperately deems.

[02:51.06]But reality lingered, veiled in night.
[02:53.95]He yearned to meet her deems
[02:56.89]Their imaginations soared to celestial height.
