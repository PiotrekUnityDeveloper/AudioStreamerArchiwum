Late Nights

Underneath the moon's soft glow,
In the quiet of the night, I stroll,
Through an empty field, I wander alone,
Lost in thoughts, in this world I've known.
The stars above whisper tales untold,

As I walk these paths, feeling bold,
In the solitude of the darkened park,
I find solace in the silence, in the dark.

Walking alone, beneath the midnight sky,
Lost in contemplation, asking why,
In the stillness, I find my way,
Through the echoes of the night, I'll sway.

With each step, memories unfold,
Of the stories left untold,
In the gentle breeze, I feel the grace,
As I journey through this empty space.

In the rustling leaves, I hear a sigh,
As the night whispers secrets, passing by,
In the solitude of the empty field,
I find the strength within to yield.

Walking alone, beneath the midnight sky,
Lost in contemplation, asking why,
In the stillness, I find my way,
Through the echoes of the night, I'll sway.

In the quiet of the night, I find peace,
As the world around me starts to cease,
With each heartbeat, I embrace the calm,
In this solitary walk, I find my balm.


// END


Walking alone, beneath the midnight sky,
Lost in contemplation, asking why,
In the stillness, I find my way,
Through the echoes of the night, I'll sway.

So I'll continue on this path, serene,
In the moonlit night, a tranquil scene,
For in solitude, I find my stride,
In the empty field, where dreams abide.
