[00:00.41]Underneath the moon's soft glow,
[00:02.28]In the quiet of the night, I stroll,
[00:07.14]Through an empty field, I wander alone,
[00:13.26]Lost in thoughts, in this world I've known.
[00:20.19]The stars above whisper tales untold,

[00:26.29]As I walk these paths, feeling bold,
[00:28.34]In the solitude of the darkened park,
[00:33.01]I find solace in the silence, in the dark.

[00:39.20]Walking alone, beneath the midnight sky,
[00:43.03]Lost in contemplation, asking why,
[00:46.87]In the stillness, I find my way,
[00:49.54]Through the echoes of the night, I'll sway.

[00:52.78]With each step, memories unfold,
[00:55.17]Of the stories left untold,
[00:59.05]In the gentle breeze, I feel the grace,
[01:02.37]As I journey through this empty space.

[01:05.52]In the rustling leaves, I hear a sigh,
[01:08.78]As the night whispers secrets, passing by,
[01:12.16]In the solitude of the empty field,
[01:16.73]I find the strength within to yield.

[01:21.83]Walking alone, beneath the midnight sky,
[01:25.29]Lost in contemplation, asking why,
[01:28.90]In the stillness, I find my way,
[01:31.18]Through the echoes of the night, I'll sway.

[01:42.18]In the quiet of the night, I find peace,
[01:47.79]As the world around me starts to cease,
[01:51.11]With each heartbeat, I embrace the calm,
[01:54.55]In this solitary walk, I find my balm.
