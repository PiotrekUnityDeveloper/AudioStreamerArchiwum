[00:22.18]In this world of chaos, we'll never fold.

[00:25.74]Life's spontaneous, dynamic, in motion,
[00:30.19]Gotta ride the wave, no time for devotion,
[00:34.93]Every beat, every rhythm, we'll seize the day,
[00:38.14]In this wild ride, we'll find our own way.

[00:51.37]From city streets to mountain peaks,
[00:53.00]Life's an adventure, no time for retreats,
[00:57.15]We'll chase the stars, we'll touch the sky,
[01:00.40]In this dynamic journey, we'll never say goodbye.

[01:02.65]Every heartbeat's a drum, every breath's a rhyme,
[01:06.99]In this symphony of life, we'll dance in time,
[01:10.55]No room for regrets, no looking back,
[01:13.35]In this world of spontaneity, we'll stay on track.

[01:18.27]Life's spontaneous, dynamic, in motion,
[01:22.65]Gotta ride the wave, no time for devotion,
[01:27.41]Every beat, every rhythm, we'll seize the day,
[01:30.23]In this wild ride, we'll find our own way.

[01:40.56]In this wild ride, we'll find our own way.

[01:43.76]So let's break free from the chains that bind,
