I Read Manga All The Time

In the pages of my manga book,
I wish for a girl with a meaningful look,
To step out of the ink and into my world,
Where loneliness and sorrow are unfurled.

But the pages remain still, silent, and cold,
As I navigate this world, feeling old,
In the depths of my despair, I drown,
Wishing for a love that can't be found.

Life's a struggle, a relentless fight,
Alone in this world, feeling forlorn.
In the colorful panels, feeling forlorn.

In the colorful panels, I find escape,
But reality's grip is hard to reshape,
I long for a touch, a voice to hear,
To chase away the shadows of my fear.

But the characters remain trapped within,
As I search for a love I can't begin,
In this void of emptiness, I dwell,
In the silence of my lonely shell.
Wishing for a love that can't be found

Life's a struggle, a relentless fight,
Alone in this world, feeling forlorn.
In the colorful panels, feeling forlorn.
In the colorful panels, feeling forlorn.

In the echoes of the night, I cry,
As the stars above seem to pass me by,


// END


In the pages of my manga, I seek reprieve,
But in reality, I'm doomed to grieve.

Life's a struggle, a relentless fight,
In the darkness of my room, I lose sight,
Of the dreams I held, now shattered and torn,
Alone in this world, feeling forlorn.

So I'll keep flipping through the pages, lost,
In a world where dreams come at a cost,
For in the depths of my despair, I'll stay,
Longing for a love that's slipped away.
