Spontaneous

Life's a rollercoaster, no time for coastin',
Spontaneous vibes, yeah, that's what I'm boastin',
Every twist, every turn, gotta embrace,
In this game of life, no time to waste.

From the break of dawn to the midnight hour,
Life's like a wildfire, can't be doused by a shower,
Every moment's a canvas, gotta paint it bold,
In this world of chaos, we'll never fold.

Life's spontaneous, dynamic, in motion,
Gotta ride the wave, no time for devotion,
Every beat, every rhythm, we'll seize the day,
In this wild ride, we'll find our own way.

From city streets to mountain peaks,
Life's an adventure, no time for retreats,
We'll chase the stars, we'll touch the sky,
In this dynamic journey, we'll never say goodbye.

Every heartbeat's a drum, every breath's a rhyme,
In this symphony of life, we'll dance in time,
No room for regrets, no looking back,
In this world of spontaneity, we'll stay on track.

Life's spontaneous, dynamic, in motion,
Gotta ride the wave, no time for devotion,
Every beat, every rhythm, we'll seize the day,
In this wild ride, we'll find our own way.
From city streets to mountain peaks,
In this wild ride, we'll find our own way.

So let's break free from the chains that bind,
In this game of life, we'll leave our fears behind.
